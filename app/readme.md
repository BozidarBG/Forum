Hello!!!

This is my second app and it is made for practise purpose. It is a forum website where users can ask questions and get some replies about those questions.

In the backend, administrator can:
<br/>   - Ban users for 2 or 7 days
<br/>   - Delete questions
<br/>   - Delete replies
<br/>   - Add new tags
<br/>   - Read complaints from other users
<br/>   - Manage sponsors

Authenticated users (including administrator) can:
<br/>   - Ask questions
<br/>   - Reply to questions
<br/>   - Like questions and replies
<br/>   - Report other users to administrator
<br/>   - Change their profile and update photo

Unauthenticated users (including authenticated users and administratirs) can:
<br/>   - See all questions and replies
<br/>   - See all users
<br/>   - Search through questions
<br/>   - See questions by Tag name
<br/>   - See info about any user


This app was made using:
<br/>    - Laravel framework
<br/>    - Bootstrap
<br/>    - jQuery
<br/>    - Ajax

Dependencies:
<br/>    - hashids: https://github.com/ivanakimov/hashids.php#readme
<br/>    - slug: cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable:^4.6
<br/>    - toastr: yoeunes/toastr
<br/>    - Cropie
<br/>    - CKEeditor

You can see it live on https://bozidar-forum.000webhostapp.com/. I have left debug=>true to see the errors.

Since I am using 000webhostapp.com and and they are blacklisted from Facebook, login with Facebook doesn't work.

Cheers!!!
